        <![CDATA[<p><strong>Microsoft Office is the office suite with a great margin of difference in the usage quota with the next option on Windows systems. It is very complete and includes more features that most users know but it is also a more expensive option than other alternatives that are free without having anything to envy for most users and use cases.</strong></p>]]>

<p>In the first article of this 2016 I commented that <a href="https://picodotdev.github.io/blog-bitix/2016/01/windows-10-and-office-2016-as-easy-to-use-without-license-as-always/">Windows and Office are still easy to use without a license</a>. License that costs nothing more and nothing less than about 125 € for <a href="https://amzn.to/3cb4v74">home and students</a> and about 250 € for <a href="https://amzn.to/3sc4aqv">home and companies</a>, by team. And if the equipment is renewed or damaged requiring the change of some components, a new license must be acquired. Given the not inconsiderable cost of the license, it is not surprising that both Windows and Office are one of the most used products without a license or pirated.</p>
<p>Given how easy it is to use Windows and Office without a license together with the <a href="https://elblogdepicodev.blogspot.com.es/2011/05/impuesto-windows.html">Windows tax</a> they have a market share in practically monopoly numbers and there are no signs that it will change in the short term. Sometimes I think that <a href="https://picodotdev.github.io/blog-bitix/2015/07/microsoft-does-not-care-if-you-use-windows-or-office-without-a-license/">Microsoft doesn’t care if you use unlicensed Windows or Office</a> for personal use. However, there are alternatives for both Windows and Office that have little to envy, much cheaper or even free and free software even with better support than <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> offers for their own software. What is not recommended to use activators because it is a source of computer viruses or trojans is better <a href="https://picodotdev.github.io/blog-bitix/2020/09/how-to-buy-a-license-and-activate-windows-10-and-office-2019/">buy a cheap license for Windows 10 and Microsoft Office</a>.</p>

<p>The alternatives to Windows are the expensive products of <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> very oriented to high ranges especially for the price or one of the many distributions <a href="https://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a>/<a href="https://www.linux.com/">Linux</a> that are practically in their entirety free and free software, although free software does not have to be without cost in most cases it is.</p>
<p>In this article I will focus more on the alternatives to Office which are also several. Leaving aside the issue of free software, Office is a good and complete office suite with more options than many users will need.</p>

<h3 id="microsoft-office">Microsoft Office</h3>
<p>Microsoft Office includes Word as a word processor, Powerpoint for presentations, Excel for spreadsheets, Access for databases, Outlook as an email client, OneNote for taking notes, or Publisher for publications. It is only available for Windows and Mac for the desktop, and the web versions for these and other systems. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/es-es/microsoft-365/explore-microsoft-365-for-home">Office 365</a> has a cost of around 8.80 € per user and month depending on the plan that includes more or fewer applications.</p>

<h3 id="libreoffice">LibreOffice</h3>
<p>The equivalent free and free alternative to Office is <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a>. It includes a text editor with Writer, spreadsheets with Calc, presentations with Impress, Draw to create graphics and Base for simple databases. However, the interface is similar to that of Office in previous editions to the incorporation of <em>ribbon</em> with an aesthetic without the feeling of being cared for. The menus are long and finding an option among the many available is not easy, when opening a menu option one can feel intimidated by its length and it is somewhat more difficult to quickly find the option you are looking for among all those displayed. There will be users who prefer the interface of menus and toolbars, I am one of those who like <em>ribbon</em> the most. It is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac.</p>

<h3 id="wps-office">WPS Office</h3>
<p>If we like the <em>ribbon</em> interface more without menus with a multitude of options and that it is more careful in terms of design than LibreOffice, similar to the one used in Microsoft Office, <a href="https://www.wps.com/">WPS Office</a> is an option to take into account, it can also be activated in classic mode with menus and toolbars supporting the editing of several documents in tabs. It only offers the basic programs of an office suite: text editor, spreadsheets and presentations. For personal use it is free with some limitations when printing and exporting documents to PDF format but more than enough even without all the options only available in the payment option.</p>
<p>For the business environment or with all its options, its license has a much more reasonable cost than Microsoft Office, 45 € for a one-year license and 80 € for a lifetime license per user.</p>
<p>It is available for Windows (XP, Vista, 7, 8, 10) even in versions for which not even Microsoft Office already offers support, Linux, Android and iOS. Its installer occupies only about 80 MiB against the more than 3 GiB of Office.</p>

<h3 id="google-docs">Google Docs</h3>
<p>Another alternative to Office is <a href="https://www.google.es/intl/es/docs/about/">Google Docs</a>, it does not have all the options that Office has but for most users it is enough. Simply have a Google account to use that includes a text editor, spreadsheets, presentations and the ability to make forms. It runs in the browser and although it is possible to work without internet connection at specific times is required. The documents are stored in the cloud so we will not lose them in case of spoiling our computer, we can access the documents from any of our devices as a smartphone o tablet, edit the same document by two or more persons simultaneously or share the documents with other people. Being based on the cloud we do not need to perform software updates except the browser.</p>
<p>For companies, it is offered at a price of 4 € per user per month that includes the Gmail email client, calendars, video calls and 30 GB of storage. It will be 8 € with more storage and retention options for messages.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.onlyoffice.com/es/">OnlyOffice</a> also offers a basic office suite consisting of documents, spreadsheets and presentations. It has a desktop application for the main operating systems and it can also be run in its own cloud hosted with <a href="https://nextcloud.com/">Nextcloud</a> preserving document ownership and without the inconvenience of Google Docs loss of privacy.

<h3 id="other-alternatives">Other alternatives</h3>
<p>Some other option that deserves to be discussed is <a href="https://www.calligra.org/">Calligra</a> the <em>suite</em> of the <a href="https://www.kde.org/">KDE desktop environment</a>, <a href="https://www.abisource.com/">Abiword</a>, <a href="https://www.lyx.org/">Lyx</a> or <a href="http://www.gnumeric.org/">Gnumeric</a>.</p>
<p>The next time they ask me to reinstall Windows or Office instead of installing Microsoft&rsquo;s office suite without a license, I think I will install the option for personal use of WPS Office, I will recommend using Google Docs, OnlyOffice or LibreOffice, which I hope will improve and update to modern times your interface when you need to install it.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p><strong>I commented in an article that it is surprising that Microsoft with the capacity that it has and being the devices connected to Internet mostly is not able to avoid using its software without license. I&rsquo;m about to see if with Windows 10 and Office 2016 it&rsquo;s still as easy to use as always. I will also have a sample of the unfair fame of Windows but that allows Microsoft for the bloatware that the device manufacturers pre-installs with its operating system.</strong></p>]]>

<p>This 2016 I have started nothing more and nothing less than installing the operating system and programs of a laptop. One of those favors that we as advanced computer users habitually do. I normally do it willingly, this time I received another in exchange for another kind, so perfect. The need for reinstallation came from the fact that the laptop was remarkably slow despite having a mechanical hard disk and it was not because the equipment was old or had little memory, the processor was an AMD Athlon x2 QL-65 with 4 GiB memory and 320GB hard drive, something that should be more than enough for the purpose of surfing the internet, watching movies, listening to music and do office tasks. It was slow to start and launching programs in addition to some antivirus message popups complaining that its trial period expired that appeared when entering the desktop. That was not all, a virus encrypted the personal files, photos and documents, asking in exchange for recovering them something that I did not even bother to see in detail, surely nothing good.</p>
<p>The computer had several bloatware programs typical of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/es-es/windows/">Windows</a> laptops provided by manufacturers, an antivirus that could fit the definition of what it tries to protect that expires after a while and leaves it unprotected, a music player that starts with the desktop and hides at the top of the screen in case you atypically need it. The manufacturers are the ones who pre-install these undesirable programs and will be the main culprits but if <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft</a> knows the bad name they give their systems, and so far has not prevented it, some guilt will have, if its operating system is an imposition in practically the whole laptops that are sold in stores, Do you know the <a href="https://elblogdepicodev.blogspot.com.es/2011/05/impuesto-windows.html">Windows tax</a>?, they could impose some condition to allow Windows pre-install and make their users happier.</p>
<p>On the other hand since Windows Vista era the computer can be reinstalled and leave as factory included all the bloatware previously quoted but for this they reserve about 10 GiB of the hard disk space that is not usable by the user. With hard drives with capacities of 320/500 GB that are reserved 10 GiB is no bigger problem but more than one has asked because its available space does not correspond with the specifications of the equipment that bought.</p>
<p>So to fix the problems I did a clean reinstallation.</p>
<h3 id="starting-the-installation">Starting the installation</h3>
<p>At the point of doing the reinstallation I had no problem, the computer had Windows 7 originally, had been upgraded to Windows 10 and activated correctly in the period of free upgrade offered by Microsoft. As I have done many times in years and with previous versions I start by <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/es-es/software-download/windows10ISO">downloading the Windows 10 installation image media</a> and <a href="http://officecdn.microsoft.com/pr/492350f6-3a01-4f97-b9c0-c7c6ddf67d60/media/es-es/HomeStudent2019Retail.img">the installation media for Microsoft Office, Home and Students</a>. I continue <a href="https://picodotdev.github.io/blog-bitix/2017/05/download-and-install-windows-10-step-by-step-from-scratch/">starting the Windows 10 installation step by step from scratch</a>. The installation media images are offered kindly by Microsoft so I had not to search them in the file sharing networks like in the older times.</p>
<p>In one of the installation steps I deleted all the partitions recovering the space reserved for the recovery partition. A few minutes of waiting, a couple of reboots and several privacy options deactivated that could give Windows 10 the name of spyware, supposedly for the sake of user, and after creating the user account the system starts with all the devices working properly including graphics card, network and WiFi. Windows is displayed as enabled.</p>
<p>I have to install the basic additional programs with the intention of being free software or respecting the licenses <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/es-ES/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> along with <a href="https://adblockplus.org/es/">AdBlockPlus</a>, <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VLC</a>, <a href="https://www.peazip.org/peazip-64bit.html">PeaZip</a>, <a href="https://www.imgburn.com/">ImgBurn</a>, <a href="https://get.adobe.com/es/reader/otherversions/">Acrobat Reader</a>, <a href="https://freefilesync.org/">FreeFilesync</a>, <a href="https://www.utorrent.com/intl/es/">uTorrent</a> to which I add <a href="https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html">Java</a>. Finally I am asked to install the office suite <a href="https://products.office.com/es-es/">Microsoft Office</a> as it will be used, my intention fails, I propose to recommend some alternative option as <a href="https://www.google.es/intl/es/docs/about/">Google Docs</a> or <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a>. However, Office is what they use, do they ask students to take a license that still costs about 125 € for students? 250 € for other mortals? It &rsquo;s the start of 2016, it&rsquo;s the weekend and I do not want to think much about it, I download the latest version of Office and I install it.</p>
<h3 id="i-try-to-activate-windows-and-office">I try to activate Windows and Office</h3>
<p>I start Word and it shows me a message that after about 30 days many of its functions will be disabled. The time comes to prove empirically once again what I said in [Microsoft does not care that you use Windows or Office without a license][blogbitix-285-en], I look for some activator in Google, there are hundreds of results, I download one from one of links that gives me some hope of not have a virus, immediately after download the executable file and Windows Defender warns that it have a virus, I run it anyway and click on the button to activate the Office, a message indicating that the activation has failed, I try several options without apparent effect to see if I am not right and Microsoft has done its job to avoid piracy. I search the links and I download another, virus warning, everything normal, I run it, icons begin to appear on the desktop of rare programs that are being installed and Firefox has been changed its home page, wow! this supposed activator was a virus, Defender was right, I will have to reinstall everything again.</p>
<h3 id="searching-an-activator-without-virus">Searching an activator without virus</h3>
<p>I put in the table the fat weapons, start a new reinstallation of Windows 10 and Office in a virtual machine with <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> that will allow me to make the tests more easily using the snapshots of the system, if something goes wrong I will be able to return to an earlier point without having to reinstall all again. I aim to find some activator that works, long ago when using Windows in the first or second, maybe the third link no more than that in Google was the activator that worked, I think again that maybe Microsoft has protected better their software. I inform myself a little more on some of the hundreds of pages, I find that I have to disable Windows Defender, as explained in those pages activate Windows and Office (any of its versions) is as easy as I remembered, use an activator and push a button. I just did not find the right one? I put a little more interest and I look for the &ldquo;official&rdquo; page of an activator, it seems that I have found one with good feelings. I disable Windows Defender, I run the activator, the activator window opens and I select to activate Windows and Office pushing button, in a few seconds it ends and it informs that the activation was correct. I check that Windows is enabled and Office is also enabled.</p>
<h3 id="i-start-the-third-installation">I start the third installation</h3>
<p>I start the third installation again on the laptop and perform the activation in the same way as in the virtual machine, except Office only since the laptop has already a legal Windows license. Office reports that it is activated. I wish I had not been able to get it.</p>
<p>It is the beginning of 2016 and I have not made one but three installations of Windows and Office, more days than the year have. And I&rsquo;m still right, using them without a license is still as easy as ever once found the right links in Google, Do a tuesday patch day will install some Windows update that discovers the crack applied to Office? I&rsquo;ll find out.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-alternatives-to-use-an-activator">What are the alternatives to use an activator</h3>
<p>Finally I used an activator but they are insecure, is better to purchase a license to one the alternative sellers to Microsoft that offer valid and legal license keys with prices much more cheaper than Microsoft. Microsoft sells the licenses of Windows starting at 145 € for Windows 10 and for Microsoft Office starting from 149 €, other sellers that can be found in <a href="https://amzn.to/2flFhHA">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://www.ebay.es/">eBay</a> offer legal licenses much more cheaper, between 10 € and 15 €. So that some personalization options does not get disabled in Windows, does not get disabled the Microsoft Office documents edition and does not appears popup messages requesting the activation is necessary to <a href="https://picodotdev.github.io/blog-bitix/2020/09/how-to-buy-a-license-and-activate-windows-10-and-office-2019/">buy a license and activate Windows 10 and Office 2019</a>.</p>
