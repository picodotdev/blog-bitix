summary: "Windows 10 and Microsoft Office 2019 are software products with a private license, to use them legally it is necessary to buy a license that allows them to be activated. Resorting to activators of these products to avoid paying the license is not recommended since they are a source of entry for computer viruses with a significant danger to the security of the computer and the importance of the tasks that we currently perform in it, such as purchases or banking inquiries. A 2012 European court ruling allows third-party vendors to offer Windows 10 and Microsoft Office 2019 licenses at significantly cheaper prices to activate these products fully legally."

### How much do Windows 10 and Microsoft Office 2019 licenses cost?

In some cases, the price of the Windows 10 license has to be purchased separately from the computer even if it is offered to do so at the same time, in the invoice the cost of the computer and the Windows 10 license will be itemized. The cost of the Windows 10 license sold by Microsoft costs between 145 € for the _Home_ version, 259 € for the _Pro_ and 439 € for the _Pro for Workstations_, it is not cheap. The Microsoft Office 2019 license sold by Microsoft costs 149 €, it also has payment methods under subscription with a monthly cost.

An additional cost in user licenses that make a new computer very expensive, taking into account some, start at 300 € and even for a 1000 € it represents a significant percentage if not higher than the hardware. [Microsoft sells _Retail_ licenses for Windows 10](https://www.microsoft.com/es-es/store/b/windows) and [Microsoft Office 2019 licenses](https://www.microsoft.com/en-eus/microsoft-365/buy/compare-all-microsoft-365-products) on their website.

There are several vendors other than Microsoft that allow you to obtain a license for Windows 10 and Microsoft Office in a completely legal, valid and forever way with very cheap prices that allow you to activate these products. [In 2012 the European Union court issued a ruling](https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2012-07/cp120094en.pdf) by which the licenses of Software sold over the internet that is no longer used by their original buyers can be bought and sold legally, this is what some sellers do buy those licenses that are no longer used and resell them to other users at low prices.

If the price of Windows 10 sold by Microsoft in its _Retail_ version is 145 € for the _Home_ version or 259 € for the _Pro_, these other sellers offer valid licenses at much cheaper prices, between about 10 € and 15 €, which represents a significant saving in this software.

### What if I don't have a Windows 10 and Microsoft Office 2019 license

[Windows 10 can be downloaded and installed from scratch][blogbitix-231-en] even without having a license to use it. However, after about 30 days Windows 10 deactivates some aesthetic customization options that do not affect its functionality, it allows you to continue using it indefinitely, including continuing to obtain the latest security updates. Some of the customization options that are disabled are applying custom themes, modifying the system colors and fonts, configuring the start menu or the wallpaper and lock screen.

If you do not want to buy a Windows 10 license, you can install a free distribution of [GNU][gnu]/[Linux][linux] such as [Ubuntu][ubuntu], [Download and install the Ubuntu distribution of GNU/Linux step stepping from scratch][blogbitix-232]. Currently, GNU/Linux operating systems like Ubuntu are just as easy to use and as intuitive as Windows, in which most additional programs are without cost and free for any functionalities that are needed, such as a photo retouching program, video player, photo viewer, web browser, etc. It is even possible [to play most Windows games with Steam on GNU/Linux][blogbitix-431] and [Wine][wine] with the same performance, common hardware is recognized without the need to install specific drivers including graphics cards, USB memory sticks and external hard drives.

Microsoft Office can also be installed but after a month it prevents the editing of documents if it is not activated, which greatly limits its functionality. Documents can be opened in read mode at any time, but to recover the editing options it is necessary to purchase your license and activate the product. If you don't want to buy a license or if you prefer to use an office suite with a free license, these are [4 of the best alternatives for Microsoft Office][blogbitix-143-en].

### Where to buy a Windows 10 and Microsoft Office 2019 license

Given the inexpensive price of vendors other than Microsoft that offer Windows 10 and Microsoft Office licenses, it is advisable to purchase a license that allows you to activate these products. Without the need to hack or resort to activators that many of them are a source of viruses and are illegal, just looking for them is a risk for the security of the computer and one of the biggest sources of entry of viruses in Windows systems since searches can lead to malicious pages. Today we do important tasks on the computer from storing numerous personal information to paying online or accessing the bank account or receipts, thus avoiding the risk of computer viruses.

Some of the sellers sell licenses through [Amazon][amazon-affiliate] or [eBay][ebay] as third-party sellers, given the popularity of these e-commerce giants it is possibly one of the most convenient options if you already have an account. Another alternative is [Goodoffer24](https://www.goodoffer24.com) that offers payment with [PayPal][paypal], others are [Digital License](https://www.digitallicense.nl), [G2Play](https://www.g2play.net), [GVGmall](https://www.gvgmall.com/), [Gamefun365](https://www.gamefun365.com/).

I do not use the Windows operating system or the Microsoft Office office suite, so I do not have the experience of how it is the result of buying on one of these pages. However, any of these pages and links offer comments and evaluations of both the product and the seller, in the case of Amazon it is usually external sellers which offer fewer guarantees, so I recommend reading both the product description and the comments of other people and ratings that the seller has. If you buy a license after reading this article you can leave a comment.

Once the purchase is made, the product activation code is sent in a few hours by email or to the account of the page. The license activation code is a character string made up of several numbers and letters separated by hyphens with the following appearance, _XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX_ that must be entered in the configuration sections of Windows 10 and Microsoft Office 2019.
